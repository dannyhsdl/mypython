Things you gotta notice when you're in reding Python codes
1. Mark the useage of functions
2. Be careful about the begining value or variables
3. You'd care about 'if' and 'else'
4. Very careful when you use while-loop 
5. Mark anywhere as you can if you don't understand what it means

You need to give people explians how actually the program works
it will remind you what you should care

follow every variable if you don't wanna get comfused
Flow Chart is stuff that is very important
Ok, these are some stuff you'd care, thank you very much!
Have a nice day.
